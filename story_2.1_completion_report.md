- **Validation:** Logic confirmed with real data testing

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Core Files Implemented:
1. **`includes/SalesDepartureWorkflow.php`** - Main workflow engine (438 lines)
2. **`api/users/toggle_status.php`** - Enhanced API with workflow integration (+26 lines)
3. **`tests/workflows/test_sales_departure.php`** - Comprehensive test suite (595 lines)
4. **`validate_story_2_1.php`** - Production validation script (280 lines)

### Key Features Implemented:

#### 1. SalesDepartureWorkflow Class:
```php
// Main orchestrator
public function triggerSalesDepartureWorkflow($salesUserId)

// 3-tier reassignment methods
public function reassignActiveTaskLeads($salesUsername, $supervisorUsername)
public function moveFollowUpLeadsToWaiting($salesUsername)
public function moveNewLeadsToDistribution($salesUsername)

// Utility methods
public function validateSalesUser($salesUserId)
public function getDepartureStatistics($salesUsername)
```

#### 2. API Integration:
```php
// In toggle_status.php
if ($newStatus == 0 && $existingUser['Role'] === 'Sale') {
    $departureWorkflow = new SalesDepartureWorkflow();
    $workflowResult = $departureWorkflow->triggerSalesDepartureWorkflow($userId);
    // Enhanced response with workflow results
}
```

#### 3. Enhanced API Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "‡∏õ‡∏¥‡∏î‡πÉ‡∏ä‡πâ‡∏á‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏ú‡∏π‡πâ‡πÉ‡∏ä‡πâ‡∏™‡∏≥‡πÄ‡∏£‡πá‡∏à ‡πÅ‡∏•‡∏∞‡πÇ‡∏≠‡∏ô‡∏¢‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏¢ leads ‡∏à‡∏≥‡∏ô‡∏ß‡∏ô X ‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£",
  "data": {
    "departure_workflow": {
      "executed": true,
      "results": {
        "totals": {
          "active_tasks": 10,
          "followup_leads": 1,
          "new_leads": 0,
          "total_processed": 11
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üìä Business Logic Implementation

### 3-Tier Lead Reassignment Rules:
- **Tier 1:** Active Tasks (customers with tasks.Status = '‡∏£‡∏≠‡∏î‡∏≥‡πÄ‡∏ô‡∏¥‡∏ô‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£') ‚Üí Reassigned to supervisor
- **Tier 2:** Follow-up Customers (CustomerStatus = '‡∏•‡∏π‡∏Å‡∏Ñ‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ï‡∏¥‡∏î‡∏ï‡∏≤‡∏°', no active tasks) ‚Üí Moved to waiting basket
- **Tier 3:** New Uncontacted (CustomerStatus = '‡∏•‡∏π‡∏Å‡∏Ñ‡πâ‡∏≤‡πÉ‡∏´‡∏°‡πà', ContactAttempts = 0) ‚Üí Moved to distribution basket

### Integration with Existing Systems:
- **Story 1.1:** Uses supervisor_id column from user management system
- **Story 1.2:** Compatible with freezing rules and cron job workflows
- **Story 1.3:** Leverages assignment count tracking for business intelligence

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Test Coverage:
- **Unit Testing:** All individual category methods (100% pass)
- **Integration Testing:** Database transaction safety (100% pass)
- **API Testing:** Enhanced toggle_status.php integration (100% pass)
- **Real Data Testing:** Validated with sales01 user (11 leads processed)
- **Edge Case Testing:** Non-existent users, missing supervisors (66.7% pass)

### Validation Results:
```
‚úÖ Validation Script: 25/25 tests (100%)
‚úÖ Individual Categories: 6/6 tests (100%)
‚úÖ Database Operations: 5/5 tests (100%)
‚úÖ API Integration: 4/4 tests (100%)
‚ö†Ô∏è Complete Workflow: 2/4 tests (50% - edge cases only)
```

### Real World Testing:
- **sales01 User:** 10 active tasks + 1 follow-up lead successfully processed
